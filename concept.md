# general mod concept: Techno Enderling
# becoming a Techno Enderling
- you have to eat a special food that can be buyed from the wandering trader
and be crafted from a warped fungus and an ender pearl
- when eaten it grants an effect, nausea and weakness
- when dying due to an enderman whilst under this effect, you respawn (even in hardcore)
as an Techno Enderling on your bed
- cheating hardcore by eating the food that make you the creature you already are
doesn't work
- there is a similar food crafted from a brown mushroom that can transform you back into
a human
- whilst under the effect, every enderman seeing you is angry at you
- you can decide at the start of the game to be a Techno Enderling and the food isn't craftable or both not (gamerule)
# general portal infos
## take entities, players, villagers with you
- you can enter the portals also while riding an entity like a boat, a minecart or a horse (variant)
- everything you rode and that rode with you will follow you

# enderworld
- by design only useful for Techno Enderlings
- is a new dimension, the origin of the Enderlings
- extremly rarely, non-renewable and persistant endermans spawn there, but there are structures that make them spawn frequently and other mobs spawn
- one-way-portals generate (else the overworld would get cluttered with
these portals when you're long enough in a world)
- pocket-portals generate
- some endertrees generate (so you can make tools to break out of a stone-layer
that you spawned in when entering a one-way-portal)
- to make tools of stone you have to go to the overworld by design
- spawning in the enderworld, as it is less dense than the overworld, you are more spread out to spawn (because 21*16 = 336: 336x336)

# pocket dimension
- unique to every player
- contains in the middle a pocket-portal
- no hostile mobs spawn

# non-buildable structures in the enderworld
## one-way-portals
- destroys 3x3x3 blocks in the overworld on the same location on entering and create a platform out of stone
- the y coordinate doesn't change, so you are probably trapped in stone, keep a pickaxe with you on going through
- maybe it splits you out at surface level yet, but x/z is correct
## pocket-portal
- only a Techno Enderling can enter
- can't be destroyed in survival (maybe because it's out of bedrock)
- very big
- can be accessed through boats and minecarts
- a Techno Enderling can repair a broken pocket portal no matter the blocks
### pocket dimension
- teleports the player to the last pocket portal the player used
### enderworld
- teleports the player to its own pocket dimension
# buildable structues
## portal
- every player can use it
- spawn naturally and activated in the overworld but nowhere else
- is build out of a glowstone block and two gold Blocks above
- right clicking and holding teleports you after some time
- breaking one block deactivates the portal
### enderworld
- lead to the overworld
- every block in the overworld corresponds to a chunk in the enderworld
- the y coordinate is exact on building
- consumes while activating 2 gold blocks and 1 glowstone block
- teleports to the nearest y-wise portal
- will break 3x3 blocks on activation on the other side (not when going through) and, if necessary, a plattform of endstone (that must be provided)
### overworld
- lead to the enderworld
- the x,z coordinate is random in the chunk, the y coordinate is exact
- on activation it clears out a 3x2x3 area
- consumes while activating 2 gold blocks and 1 glowstone block
- teleports to the nearest y-wise portal
- will break 3x3 blocks on activation on the other side (not when going through) and, if necessary, a plattform of Stone (that must be provided)

### nether
- because of the nether being so intertwined, you can use the portal here to teleport to known other portals in the nether
- Players need an enderpearl to teleport that is consumed

### end
- you spawn on your spawn, just as if you've gone through the end-portal
- if your spawn in in the end, then you spawn in the overworld at world spawn or the enderworld, depending on who you are

## enderling anchor
- only Techno Enderlings can use them
- if a non-Techno-Enderling uses them, they explode
- on every other dimension than the pocket dimension, you reset your spawn point there
- works on every dimension, including the nether and the end
- on the pocket dimension it teleports you to your spawn point on holding right click (so it can't be abused as easy block breaker)
- build out of an amethyst block and 8 copper blocks surrounding
## reactor
- they only work in the enderworld
- need a core and a mantle
- the core is just crying obsidian
- the mantle covers every side of the crying obsidian
- the reactor needs a sacrifice on activation
### overworld reactor
- mantle: stone
- sacrifice:
    - 16 rotten flesh
    - 16 bones
    - 16 strings
    - 16 gunpowder
### weak ender reactor
- mantle: magenta or purple glass
- sacrifice: 1 ender pearl
- spawns an enderman every some minutes
### strong ender reactor
- mantle: purpur block
- sacrifice: 16 ender pearls
- spawns endermans as in the end
### nether reactor
- mantle: nether rack
- sacrifice: 16 gold ingots
- spawn creatures like in the nether waste biome
### nether fortress reactor
- mantle: weak nether bricks
- sacrifice: 16 blaze rods
- spawns nether fortress mobs, but only on nether bricks
- wither roses can be placed on nether bricks

## Enderling Ward
- there is a weak, medium and strong ward
- the weak needs an iron block as core
- the medium needs a diamond block as core
- the strong needs a beacon block as core
- the core is surrounded by end Stone bricks
- the lower side has two end stone bricks
### pocket dimension
- gives you more space in your pocket dimension
- only works when placed on top of the portal in the fitting position
### enderworld, end
- no effects here
### overworld
- repells water
### nether
- repells lava

# things to consider when building this mod
- don't let the player abuse the pocket dimension teleportation
to "remember" one location (shouldn't be possible)
- the endermans has to spawn very rarely in the enderworld so
the eating nerf is actually a huge nerf
- taking with you villagers, players and animals is wanted

# abilities
- can build structures and activate them using the primary ability, they use up ender essence
and maybe some items as sacrifice
- spawns naturally in the enderworld
- can absorb ender pearls by shift right click-holding them
- can absorb up to 4 enderpearls
- when the ender essence runs out, it automatically refreshes from the consumed enderpearls
- can't eat
- ender essence slowly (!!) replenish saturation
- because you didn't lived in the end, only in the enderworld, you don't have the usual enderman properties like being damaged from water, being 3 blocks tall or being able to teleport without aid
- your skin is a little darker
- you can sleep, but this won't reset your spawn
- you can enter pocket portals
- endermans don't get aggressive when you look at them (that's actually a nerf because they don't teleport to you when you look at them)
